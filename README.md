# Workday Scheduler

## Description:

The purpose of this project is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This web app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery.

### This will completed by...

- [x] When the planner is opened the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- [x] When scrolling down, the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours
- [x] When viewing the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- [x] Clicking a time block takes user to enter an event
- [x] Clicking the save button for that time block saves the text for that event in local storage so it will persist when the page is refreshed
